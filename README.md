# 🎨 Paint – Python Drawing App

This is a custom Paint application built using **Pygame** and **Tkinter**, created as my very first Python project in Grade 11 Computer Science.

The program lets users draw on a canvas using different tools, pick colors, use stamps, and even add music—all while learning how graphical user interfaces work behind the scenes.
